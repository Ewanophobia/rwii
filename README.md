# rwii
a port of the roblox client to the wii

# motivation
homebrew apps are really interesting to me, and c was a language i've wanted to learn for a while, so i decided this would be a good way to dip my toes in.

# prerequisites
- your wii needs to have a solid internet connection
- latest version of ios (4.3)

# installation
1. download the [latest release](https://github.com/Ewanophobia/rwii/releases)
